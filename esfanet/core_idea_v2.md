Problem: Deep ensembles and multimodal systems are poorly calibrated and opaque under uncertainty.
Gap: Most fusion methods operate on features/logits and ignore epistemic uncertainty.
Solution: Evidence-level dynamic gating guided by uncertainty.
Outcome: Better calibration + interpretable agent trust dynamics.
