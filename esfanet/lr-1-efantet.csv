Focused on gene expression regression, unlike the classification focus of BreakHis/EFSANet.","ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet used as the feature extractor for tiles.","Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to aggregate tile features into slide-level representations, allowing varying contributions of tiles.","Not explicitly modeled via EDL, but analyzes attention weights as a proxy for relevance/confidence in contributing to the label.","Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression; Adam optimizer.","Spearman correlation (0.35-0.38) between predicted and actual gene expression; Attention models showed slightly higher sensitivity to domain shift.","Attention mechanisms showed poorer generalizability (domain shift) compared to simple mean pooling in regression settings.","Validates the use of attention to weight informative tiles, supporting EFSANet's strategy of using attention before pooling. Warns about domain shift risks which EFSANet's EDL helps mitigate.","Attention mechanisms... allow models to better capture the relationship between set and instance labels [when] relatively few images contribute."
